Retrieving data from [metafields](/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions/apis/standardapi#properties-propertydetail-appmetafields) during checkout is faster since it won't introduce an external network call. This allows you to rely on Shopify for the uptime, scaling, and durability of the data storage.

When processing HTTP requests on your API server, you cannot guarantee that your own extension will have made every request. When responding with sensitive data, keep in mind that requests could originate from anywhere on the Internet.

Your extension can pass a [session token](/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions/unstable/apis/session-token) to your API server but this only guarantees the integrity of its claims. It does not guarantee the request itself originated from Shopify. For example, your API server could trust the session token's \`sub\` claim (the customer ID) but it could not trust a \`?customer_id=\` query parameter.

Consider a scenario where your extension retrieves a discount code from your API server and [applies it to the checkout](/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions/apis/standardapi#properties-propertydetail-applydiscountcodechange). It would not be safe to expose an API endpoint named \`/get-discount-code\` if any buyer could make a direct HTTP request and obtain a discount code.

UI extension requests made to the App Proxy will not assign the <code>logged_in_customer_id</code> query parameter. Instead use a [session token](/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions/unstable/apis/session-token) which provides the <code>sub</code> claim for the logged in customer.

UI extension requests made to the App Proxy of password protected shops is not supported. Extension requests come from a web worker which does not share the same session as the parent window.

When developing a local extension, you can remove the \`block_progress\` capability from your \`shopify.extension.toml\` file to simulate a merchant disallowing the capability.

For specific targets, you must provide the URL of assets or pages loaded by UI components within its extension. This allows Shopify to preload them as early as possible and ensure a performant experience for buyers. Currently, the only supported property is \`chat\` for the [\`Chat\` component](/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions/latest/components/overlays/chat).

The \`chat\` property specifies the URL for the iframe used in this extension target. The URL can be absolute or relative. Relative URLs are resolved against the app URL defined in the app configuration.

For example,

* if the app URL is \`https://example.com\` and \`chat = "/my-chat-application"\`, the resolved URL will be \`https://example.com/my-chat-application\`.
* if \`chat = "https://my-chat-application.com"\`, the resolved URL will be \`https://my-chat-application.com\`.
