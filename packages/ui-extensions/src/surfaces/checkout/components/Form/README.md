# Form

The form component should be used to wrap one or more form controls. This
component provides an &#34;implicit submit&#34; behavior, where customers can submit
the form from any input by pressing &#34;Enter&#34; on their keyboards. This
behavior is widely expected, and should be respected as often as possible.

Unlike an HTML `form` element, this component does not support configuring
the descendant fields to be submitted via HTTP automatically. Instead, you
must provide an `onSubmit` callback that will perform the necessary HTTP
requests in JavaScript.
